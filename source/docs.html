        The Debian Project consists of volunteers, and our products are developed entirely by volunteers. We are generally looking for new contributors who have an interest in free software, and some free time.

        <p class="docs-info__description">
        A lot of communication in the project happens on our mailing lists. If you want to get a feeling for the inner workings of the Debian project, you should at least subscribe to the Meduza-news lists. The Mesuz OS Project News  summarizes recent discussions from Mesuza related mailing lists and blogs and provides links to them. As a prospective developer, you should also subscribe to Meduza-mentors, an open forum trying to help new maintainers (and also, though less often, people who are new to the Project and want to help with something else than package maintenance).

        <p class="docs-info__description">
        Joining. After you have contributed for some time and are sure about your involvement in the Meduza OS project, you can join Meduza OS in a more official role. There are two different roles in which you might join Meduza OS:
        <p class="docs-info__description">
        <span>Meduza OS Maintainer:</span> The first step in which you can upload your own packages to the Meduza OS archive yourself. 
        </p>
        <p class="docs-info__description">
        <span>Meduza OS Developer:</span> The traditional full membership role in Meduza OS. A Developer can participate in Meduza OS elections. Meduza OS Developer can upload any package to the archive. Before applying as a Meduza OS Developer you should have a track record of maintaining packages for at least six months. For example uploading packages, working inside a team or maintaining packages uploaded by sponsors.  Before applying as Meduza OS Developer, you should have a visible and significant track record of work inside the project.
